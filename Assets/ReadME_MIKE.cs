    //Hi Mike this is just my note to explain myself in this Project.
    //what movement prototype you experimented with and why you chose it?
    //I wanted to use a joystick with basic smooth movment controls main because thats what im going to use in my final vr project so I thought it 
    //would work best plus if I use it as a joysick i also knock down mapping and special interaction all in one go. Can be found in my playermovement script.

    //what interaction prototypes you implemented and why?
    //how you met the interaction prototype requirements mentioned above?
    //So for the interactions I used mainly 2 buttons. one you see on the desk2 and it behaves like a real life button press it and it spings down. you
    //really have to press it though for it to move covering a real phsyic interaction. I added throwables to the objects i had mainly because they were there from my other project and
    //in testing i could hit desk2's button with it. the other was a menu button on the UI that could make an object dissapear and reappear using the 
    //front trigger on the controller covering custom mapping and menu. The scripts can be found under dissapear and button. Again i implemented these mostly due to
    //my need to require these in my final project so it was a good step to try. ex making the cell door dissapear and useing the buttons like a key pad.
